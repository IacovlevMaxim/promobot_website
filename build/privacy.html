        <h4>Server info:</h4>
        <p class="paragraph serif">If you didnt setup the server, Promobot doesnt store any data about this server and only has access to data that is available through Discord API.</p>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">If you completed the setup, Promobot stores:</p>
        <ul class="paragraph serif">
          <li>Server ID (accessable through Discord API)</li>
          <li>Promo channel ID (provided during setup, accessable through Discord API)</li>
          <li>Promo message (provided during setup)</li>
          <li>Category of this server (provided during setup)</li>
          <li>Discord invite to that server (provided during setup)</li>
          <li>How many times this server was promoted in last 24 hours, counting from 00:00 UTC (updated everytime pr$promo command was successfully completed)</li>
          <li>Timestamp of last promotion (updated everytime pr$promo command was successfully completed)</li>
          <li>Is this server banned from using Promobot or not</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">If your server applied for whitelisting and got successfully accepted for it, Promobot additionally stores:</p>
        <ul class="paragraph serif">
          <li>Promo channel ID that should be whitelisted</li>
          <li>Server ID that should be whitelisted</li>
          <li>Role ID(-s) that should be whitelisted</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">If you would like to get this data removed from the database, remove Promobot from your Discord server and all data will be cleared. However, if your server was banned from Promobot usage, ban state data will not be removed and will be stored forever to prevent using the bot in the future.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>User info:</h4>
        <p class="paragraph serif">If a user never voted for Promobot on top.gg and never submitted Promobot whitelist request, Promobot doesnt store any data about this user and only access data that is available through Discord API.</p>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">If you voted for Promobot on top.gg, Promobot stores:</p>
        <ul class="paragraph serif">
          <li>ID of user who voted (received from Top.gg API)</li>
          <li>Timestamp of last vote (calculated when vote is received by the bot)</li>
          <li>Whether user used the vote or not (updated everytime user uses pr$promo command)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">If you would like to get this data removed from the database, please join <a href="https://discord.gg/dXES6RYtAq"><b>Promobot support server</b></a> and DM server owner with your request.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>What data is publically available?</h4>
        <p class="paragraph serif">Everything that can be accessed through Discord app or through Discord API is counted as publically available. Any info that is not publically available is not revealed to any other individuals or third-party services, except for any statements in Privacy Policy that make exceptions for it.</p>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">Promobot may display links to certain third party websites, such as top.gg. I encourage you to read the individual privacy policies of those third party websites before providing any of your personal information to them.</p>
        <br />

        <p class="paragraph serif">I may change privacy policy from time to time. Latest version of Promobot Privacy Policy will be posted here. I encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis so that you will be aware of any changes to it.</p>
